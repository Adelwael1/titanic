 # Titanic Dataset Visualization ðŸš¢ðŸ“Š
 ## Overview
This project explores and visualizes the Titanic dataset, aiming to uncover patterns and insights about passenger survival rates based on different factors. Using Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn, we analyze relationships between passenger class, age, gender, fare, embarkation points, and survival outcomes through interactive and meaningful visualizations.

## Key Features
âœ… Data Cleaning & Preprocessing â€“ Handling missing values and preparing data for analysis.
âœ… Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) â€“ Identifying trends in passenger demographics and survival rates.
âœ… Survival Analysis â€“ Visualizing the impact of age, gender, and class on survival chances.
âœ… Comparative Analysis â€“ Examining differences in ticket fares, embarkation points, and passenger classes.
âœ… Interactive & Engaging Visualizations â€“ Using Matplotlib & Seaborn to create insightful graphs.

 ## Technologies Used
ðŸ“Œ Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
ðŸ“Œ Jupyter Notebook for interactive data exploration
ðŸ“Œ CSV dataset containing detailed Titanic passenger information

 ## Dataset Information
The dataset includes:

Passenger ID & Name
Survival Status (Survived or Not)
Pclass (Ticket Class)
Age & Gender
Fare & Embarkation Port
